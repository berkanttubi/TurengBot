# TurengBot
This bot mainly created for doing translation(eng-tur) interactively while reading ebook from PC. It uses Firefox with headless operation but you can change it. The first searching can take some time due to several reasons like opening the browser and going to Tureng page... After the first search, other will be much more faster.

Needed packages:
